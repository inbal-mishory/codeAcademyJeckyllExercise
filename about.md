This little blog came about while doing some git and jekyll exercise for codeacademy.
Hopefully now and again I will update it.

You can find the source code for the Jekyll new theme at:
{% include icon-github.html username="jglovier" %} /
[jekyll-new](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new)

You can find the source code for Jekyll at
{% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %} /
[jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
