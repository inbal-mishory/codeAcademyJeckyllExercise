# 2018 current projects

Current projects going on:

- Jekyll github pages static website (this one...)
- *[Angular Front To Back](https://www.udemy.com/angular-4-front-to-back/learn/v4/content)* an angular 5 course on udemy.
- AWS hosted EC2 instance running a Node & Express server and serving up my own [chat app](http://ec2-54-68-52-174.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/chat.html) I created using socket.io.
Still working on keeping it online, maybe adding Elastic Beanstalk and changing the UI stuff.
