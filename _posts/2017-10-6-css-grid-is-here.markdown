Well, It's official, [css grid layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout), AKA 2d layout is finally here!
After suffering for years with floats and their terrible side affects, it is finally possible to create real 2 dimensional grids for displaying your content. Flex display has dramatically changed the way we can layout elements and most importantly allowed vertical alignment of any element, but flexbox is designed for one dimensional layout, like boxes in a row or column, once you have more rows and columns things get very confusing very quickly.
Here's an example of a layout I got stuck trying to figure out in flex:
![rowspan example image](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/104215/rowspan.png)

Specifically how to get an element to span two rows using flexbox. I found a way, but I still have no real understanding of how it works. Not intuitive at all.

I am really excited to start working with grid. Here are some resources to help you start working with CSS grid today:
